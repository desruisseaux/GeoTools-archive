      This chapter describes, first, how to obtain the library and the 
      tools required to be able to use the Geotools library and, second, 
      how to use these libraries to display a map on screen with an 
      exceedingly primitive application. 
    </para>

    <para>
      The chapter assumes that the programmer understands the following:
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>
          The Java (tm) Programming Language
          </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            The basics of Geographic Information Systems 
          </para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      This chapter tries not to assume any other specialized knowledge; 
      the examples therefore start from the basic desktop of modern GUI 
      operating systems either of the UNIX heritage, namely GNU based or 
      MacOS X, or from the CPM heritage, namely Windows (tm). Since each
      programmer uses her own tools to actually develop her programs, each 
      will have to adapt these examples to fit her own needs.

    <para>
      Geotools requires a Java VM and two imaging libraries, the 
      Java Advanced Imaging library and the Java Image I/O library. These 
      must all be configured correctly for the examples which follow.
    </para>
    
    <para>
      Most developers use the Java Software Developers' Kit (SDK) provided by 
      Sun Microsystems (TM) which is available at no charage from the 
      <ulink url="http://java.sun.com/" type="http">Java webpage</ulink>. The 
      Java SDK can be installed by following the instructions on that web page. 
      The Java SDK provides both the necessary Java Runtime Environment with its
      virtual machine and the tools and libraries necessary to compile a Java 
      application
    </para>

    <para>
      The two imaging libraries must be obtained from Sun Microsystems (TM). They 
      are also available at no charage. The Java Advanced Imaging library can be 
      obtained from the 
      <ulink url="http://java.sun.com/" type="http">JAI webpage</ulink> while the 
      Java Image I/O library can be obtained from the
      <ulink url="http://java.sun.com/" type="http">Java Image I/O webpage</ulink>. 
      Both libraries can be installed by following the instructions on their 
      respective web pages. 
    </para>
    
    <para>
      Once these Java components are installed, a minimal amount of 
      configuration will ensure that the java environment can be found. Two 
      environmental variables generally need to be modified or set. The PATH 
      envirnomental variable must be modified to include the directory containing 
      the binary applications provided by the SDK so that the runtime and compiler 
      can be found by the shell. For example, on a GNU system using the tcsh, a
      user would type "setenv PATH /path/to/the/j2sdk/bin:$PATH". The JAVA_HOME 
      environmental variable must also be set to provide acess to the location 
      of the java installation. For example, again on a GNU system using the 
      tcsh, a user would type "setenv JAVA_HOME /path/to/the/j2sdk/".

  <sect2 id="sect-quick-start-getGt">
    <title>Get Geotools</title>

    <para>
      Geotools is distributed in three separate pieces: as a binary 
      distribution, as a source distribution, and as a javadoc collection. 
      Each of these can be obtained from the 
      <ulink url="http://www.geotools.org/" type="http">project website</ulink>.
    </para>
    
    <para>
      Most developers get all three components although only the binary 
      distribution is required for this demo. Once the binary distribution is 
      downloaded, it must be unzipped. Persumably most users will expand the zip
      archive somewhere in their home directory. Once expanded the binary 
      distribution contains only a series of JAR files, each representing a 
      different component of the final application.
    </para>

<sect1 id="sect-quick-start-runDemo">
    <title>Run the Demo</title>

    <para>
      Geotools contains a handy demonstration application which is useful
      both to ensure that the libraries are properly installed and to get 
      programmers started exploring each of the different areas of the 
      library.
    </para>

    <para>
      Once the Java libraries have been configured and the binary distribution of 
      &lib; installed, a simple demonstration program can be run with the 
      following command:
      <literallayout>
java -jar /path/to/gt2-demo-introduction-VERSION_NUMBER.jar org.geotools.demo.introduction.QuickStartGUI
      </literallayout>
      where "path/to/" is altered to point to the installation directory of the
      JAR files and "VERSION_NUMBER" is the number of the &lib; release.
    </para>

    <para>
      This command will lead to the following window:

            as a label, buttons, and a text area, but also uses the JMapPane

            with tools to manipulate those data.

<sect1 id="sect-quick-start-readDeom">
  <title>Read the Code</title>

  <para>
    The source code for the Demo application provides a quick introduction 
    to each of the major modules of the code library. The source walks 
    through the process of creating Features, both programatically and from 
    various sources such as shapefile and web servers. The source then
    discusses how to create styles and display a map. The source continues 
    by discussing advanced features of the &lib; library.
  </para>

  <para>
    The source is contained in the
      <filename>org.geotools.demo.introduction.DemoApp.java</filename>
      source file within the 
      <filename>gt2-demo-introduction-VERSION.jar</filename>
      JAR file (where VERSION is replaced by the current version number).
  </para>

  <note>
    <title>The code is static and sequential</title>
    <para>
      The code in the &lib; Demo is created for legibility not for elegant 
      design. All methods are static, as are most variables, and the class
      itself is never instantiated. The idea is to have each button linked
      to one or more self-contained methods, each of which is then discussed 
      below.
