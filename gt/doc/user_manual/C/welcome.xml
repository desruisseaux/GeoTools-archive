    Geotools is a code library for Geospatial applications. The 
    library is intended to provide foundational object classes for 
    creating geographic information systems. The library is 
    written in the Java computer language, currently using 
    version &javaVersion;. For more details, visit the Geotools project 
    <ulink url="http://www.geotools.org/" type="http">webpage</ulink>.
  </para>


  <para>
    This manual intends to help people develop software programs which use part
    or all of the Geotools library to create their own geospatial applications. 
    These programmers are considered <emphasis>users</emphasis> of the &geot; 
    library.
    This manual is intended to help programers learn how to use both the 
    GeoTools library itself and closely related libraries such as the GeoAPI 
    and JTS libraries.

    <para>
      The Users' Manual is incomplete. Hopefully a first version will be
      released with an upcoming version of the Geotools library.

    &geot; can be used to build applications of many different types including 
    network server applications and desktop clients. The library consists of 
    various modules which can be combined according to programmer needs. An 
    example client application is included as the &geot; demo shown in <xref
      linkend="fig-geotools-demo-render" /> .

  	    The &geot; demonstration application uses swing components, such 
              as a label, buttons, and a text area, but also uses the JMapPane
              component to display geospatial data and provide a simple toolbar 
              with tools to manipulate those data.

    <para>
      This manual will get users started using the geotools codebase. We hope
      the manual can get users to the point that they can continue on their 
      own by reading the GeoAPI and Geotools javadocs along with the source 
      code. Advanced questions should be addressed to the mailing list or 
      raised in the Internet Relay Chat (IRC) room.

    <title>The Users' Manual vs the Developers' Guide</title>
    <para>
      The Users' Manual is <emphasis>not</emphasis> a guide to developing and 
      improving the &geot; library itself.
    </para>
    <para> 
      The Developers' Guide provides helpful information for those who want to
      contribute to the library itself. For more information, see the 
      <ulink url="http://www.geotools.org/Develop/" type="http">developers page
      </ulink> of the web site.

    <title>Geotools is a library <emphasis>not</emphasis> an application.</title>
    <para>
      Geotools provides almost no graphical user interface functionality. Several 
      efforts may yield more user interface elements, notably the GO-1 module in 
      the gt/ext/go directory and the 
      <ulink url="http://geowidgets.sourceforge.net/" type="http">
        GeoWidgets project
      </ulink> which will hopefully provide widgets based on the 
      <ulink url="http://geoapi.sourceforge.net/" type="http">
        GeoAPI
      </ulink> interfaces. 
    </para>

    <para>
      There are two notable projects which leverage Geotools to provide 
      higher level functionality:

            </ulink> is a network server to provide maps using the Web 
            Mapping Standard (WMS) or to provide individual features using the 
            Web Feature Standard (WFS) and its transactional extension, the Web 
            Feature Standard for Transactions (WFS-T).  
          </para>

      </itemizedlist>
    </para>

    <para>
      There are also many other software projects for 
      spatial data which may be easier to use for simple projects than the 
      Geotools library. For example, the 
      <ulink url="http://www.jump-project.org/" type="http">
        JUMP
      </ulink> project and its 
      <ulink url="http://openjump.org/" type="http">
        OpenJUMP
      </ulink> fork are reputedly easy to use. The 
      <ulink url="http://www.freegis.org/" type="http">
        FreeGIS
      </ulink> project attempts to maintain a list of the free software 
      projects related to geospatial data. Those projects, or others like 
      them, may be a better place to start than working directly with the
      library itself.
