/**
 * Base class for simple image decoders. The main simplification provided by this class is to
 * assume that only one {@linkplain ImageTypeSpecifier image type} is supported (as opposed to
 * the arbitrary number allowed by the standard {@link ImageReader}) and to provide a default
 * image type built automatically from a color palette and a range of valid values.
 * <p>
 * More specifically, this class provides the following conveniences to implementors:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><p>Provides a {@link #getInputStream} method, which returns the {@linkplain #input input}
 *       as an {@link InputStream} for convenience. Different kinds of input like {@linkplain File}
 *       or {@linkplain URL} are automatically handled.</p></li>
 *
 *   <li><p>Provides default {@link #getNumImages} and {@link #getNumBands} implementations,
 *       which return 1. This default behavior matches simple image formats like flat binary
 *       files or ASCII files. Those methods need to be overrided for more complex image
 *       formats.</p></li>
 *
 *   <li><p>Provides {@link #checkImageIndex} and {@link #checkBandIndex} convenience methods.
 *       Those methods are invoked by most implementation of public methods. They perform their
 *       checks based on the informations provided by the above-cited {@link #getNumImages} and
 *       {@link #getNumBands} methods.</p></li>
 *
 *   <li><p>Provides default implementations of {@link #getImageTypes} and {@link #getRawImageType},
 *       which assume that only one {@linkplain ImageTypeSpecifier image type} is supported. The
 *       default image type is created from the informations provided by {@link #getRawDataType}
 *       and {@link #getImageMetadata}.</p></li>
 *
 *   <li><p>Provides {@link #getStreamMetadata} and {@link #getImageMetadata} default
 *       implementations, which return {@code null} as authorized by the specification.
 *       Note that subclasses should consider returning
 *       {@link org.geotools.image.io.metadata.GeographicMetadata}.</p></li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * Images may be flat binary or ASCII files with no meta-data and no color information.
 * Their pixel values may be floating point values instead of integers. The default
 * implementation assumes floating point values and uses a grayscale color space scaled
 * to fit the range of values. Displaying such an image may be very slow. Consequently,
 * users who want to display image are encouraged to change data type and color space with
 * <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/jai/">Java Advanced Imaging</a>
 * operators after reading.
