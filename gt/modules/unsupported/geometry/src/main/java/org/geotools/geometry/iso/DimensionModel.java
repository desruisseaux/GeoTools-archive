/**
 * The class Dimension represents the dimension type of a Feature Geometry. It
 * supports three dimension types:
 * 
 * 2D - Geometry objects in two dimensional euclidian space with the coordinates
 * x and y. Geometric objects in that dimension model do not store any
 * information about height in their geometry attributes.
 * 
 * 2.5D - Geometry objects in three dimensional euclidian space with the
 * coordinates x and y, and owns a height attribute z. Therefore, each
 * coordinate pair only holds one height information. This relation can be
 * defined by the bijectional function f(x,y) -> z.
 * 
 * 3D - Geometry objects in three dimensional euclidian space with the
 * coordinates x, y and z. Since we are in real three dimensional space,
 * coordinates with the same x and y values, but different z values are allowed.
 * This provides the representation of overlaying objects like bridges over a
 * river or tunels through a mountain.
 * 
 * The distinction between 2d (which is in 2 dimensional euclidian space) and
 * 2.5d (which is in 2 dimensional euclidian space) objects is essential,
 * because the simple disctinction between the coordiante dimension (euclidian
 * space) would make the seperation of 2d and 3d data impossible. In fact, there
 * is a huge discrepancy in algorithms and their runtime complexity in spatial
 * operation which treat 2d data and 3d data. 3D algorithms are usually
 * absolutely ineffecient for 2D data, so that a seperation between the two
 * dimensionalities must be done. However, 2d data algorithms can usually be
 * designed in a way to treat 2.5d data correclty as well without effecting the
 * runtime complexity.
