  <BODY>
    This package contains the support classes necessary to implement a <code>GridCoverageExchange</code> and the 
    data formats, such as ArcGrid or Geotiff.  
    The <code>StreamGridCoverageExchange</code> is an example of a <code>GridCoverageExchange</code>.
    <p>
    The <code>AbstractGridFormat</code> class is a helper class to make implementing GridFormats simpler.
    <p>
    </p>
    Currently the <code>StreamGridCoverageExchange</code> is hardcoded with only the ArcGrid format.  In the future a plug-in 
    framework will be added so the formats can be found dynamically.
