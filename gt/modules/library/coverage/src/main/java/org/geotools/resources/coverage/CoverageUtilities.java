     * General purpose method used in various operations for {@link GridCoverage2D} to help

     *
     * <p>
     * The need for this method arose in consideration of the fact that applying most operations
     * on coverage whose {@link ColorModel} is an instance of {@link IndexColorModel} may lead to
     * unpredictable results depending on the applied {@link Interpolation} (think about applying
     * "Scale" with {@link InterpolationBilinear} on a non-geophysics {@link GridCoverage2D} with an
     * {@link IndexColorModel}) or more simply on the operation itself ("SubsampleAverage" cannot
     * be applied at all on a {@link GridCoverage2D} backed by an {@link IndexColorModel}).
     *
     * <p>
     * This method suggests the actions to take depending on the structure of the provided
     * {@link GridCoverage2D}, the provided {@link Interpolation} and if the operation uses
     * a filter or not (this is useful for operations like SubsampleAverage or FilteredSubsample).
     *
     * <p>
     * In general the idea is as follows: If the original coverage is backed by a
     * {@link RenderedImage} with an {@link IndexColorModel}, we have the following cases:
     *
     * <ul>
     *  <li>if the interpolation is {@link InterpolationNearest} and there is no filter involved
     *      we can apply the operation on the {@link IndexColorModel}-backed coverage with nor
     *      problems.</li>
     *  <li>If the interpolations in of higher order or there is a filter to apply we have to
     *      options:
     *      <ul>
     *        <li>If the coverage has a twin geophysics view we need to go back to it and apply
     *            the operation there.</li>
     *        <li>If the coverage has no geophysics view (an orthophoto with an intrisic
     *            {@link IndexColorModel} view) we need to perform an RGB(A) color expansion
     *            before applying the operation.</li>
     *      </ul>
     *  </li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>
     * A special case is when we want to apply an operation on the geophysics view of a coverage
     * that does not involve high order interpolation of filters. In this case we suggest to apply
     * the operation on the non-geophysics view, which is usually much faster. Users may ignore
     * this advice.
     *
     * @param coverage to check for the action to take.
     * @param interpolation to use for the action to take.
     * @param hasFilter if the operation we will apply is going to use a filter.
     * @param hints to use when applying a certain operation.
