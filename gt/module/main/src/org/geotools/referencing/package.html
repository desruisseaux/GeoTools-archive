  <BODY>
  {@linkplain org.geotools.referencing.ReferenceSystem Reference systems} implementation. An
  explanation for this package is provided in the {@linkplain org.opengis.referencing OpenGIS&reg; javadoc}.
  The remaining discussion on this page is specific to the Geotools implementation.

  <P ALIGN="justify">This package provides implementations for general positioning, coordinate
  reference systems (CRS), and coordinate transformations. Coordinates can have any number of
  dimensions. So this implementation can handle 2D and 3D coordinates, as well as 4D, 5D etc.</P>

  <P ALIGN="justify">Most interfaced objects are immutable. This means that implementations promise
  not to change an object's internal state once they have handed out an interface pointer. Since
  most interfaced objects are specified to be immutable, there do not need to be any constraints
  on operation sequencing. This means that these interfaces can be used in parallel computing
  environments (e.g. internet servers).</P>
