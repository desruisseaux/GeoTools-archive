  <BODY>
    Utility classes which enable dynamic binding to factory implementations at runtime.
    
    <P ALIGN="justify">Because Geotools core API consists almost excusivly of interfaces
    (including <A HREF="http://geoapi.sourceforge.net">GeoAPI</A>), factories play a vital
    role in how developers use the API. Although the interfaces that are declared in GeoAPI
    are implemented in various Geotools packages you should not use those classes directly.
    Instead you should use factories.</P>
 
    <P ALIGN="justify">J2SE's {@link javax.imageio.spi.ServiceRegistry} provides a truly general
    way (even if it is defined in a <code>javax.imageio</code> subpackage) to instantiate and
    manage factories (also called providers). This <code>org.geotools.factory</code> package
    follows the same spirit and provides some more capabilities, for example allowing a
    factory to be specified as a {@linkplain java.lang.System#getProperty system property}.</P>
