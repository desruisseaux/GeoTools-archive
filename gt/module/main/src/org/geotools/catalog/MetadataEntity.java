/**
 * Interface for progamatic access to the Metadata content.
 * <p>
 * This API is used by Catalog to query against CatalogEntry Metadata.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Conceptually a Metadata is comprised of a series of elements. These elements
 * are described by an associated EntityType & Element schema
 * information.
 * </p>
 * </p>
 * In the best of all possible worlds the EntityType is a member of a
 * well known specification such as ISO19115 (Metadata for spatial data), or
 * ISO19119 (Metadata for Services). GeoAPI kindly provides these abstractions
 * as a series of interfaces, which we are in the process of implementing.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The Metadata interface is similar in use to that of the Feature, it has
 * the same relationship with EntityType that Feature has with FeatureType.
 * By extention Element is similar to AttributeType.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Aside: Many classes that implement Metadata follow Java Bean property
 * conventions to allow for element access. This is not a requirement.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Internationalization: Accounting for internationlization is an interesting
 * problem with metadata.
 * <ul>
 * <li>One way is to provide a language metadata and only query against
 * Metadata that matches the language you are interested in.
 * <li>Another way is to return a "InternationalString" that knows how to write
 * itself out in the Locale you are interested in.
 * <li>Consider use of a elemnts( Locale ) method
 * <li>Finally you can ignore the problem
 * </ul> 
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This interface is based on the discussion in the Abstract Catalog specification:
 * <pre><code>
 * 4.6 Metadata dataset
 *     Metadta describing a specific dataset [ISO 19101]
 * 
 * 4.7 Metadata entity
 *     Group of metadata elements and other metadata entities describing the same
 *     aspect of data.
 * 
 * NOTE 1  A metadata entity may contain one or more metadata entities
 * NOTE 2  A metadata is equivalent to a class in UML terminology [ISO 19101]
 * 
 * 4.8 Metadata schema
 *     Conceptual schema describing metadata
 * 
 * NOTE ISO 19115 describes a standard for a metadata schema [ISO 19101]
 * </code></pre>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * 
 * @UML abstract CG_Catalog (Figure 6)
 * @see ISO 19101
 * @see ISO 19115
