/**
 * A Catalog is simply a collection of Catalog Entries that is organized to assist in the discovery,
 * access, and retrieval of geospatial resources that are of interest to the user, especially when the
 * existence or whereabouts of the resource are not know to the user.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Being a collection of catalog entries, a catalog should be able to enumerate each of its entries, and
 * should allow entries to be added or removed. It should also support queries that will enable the
 * user to obtain entries of interest based on specified criteria.
 * </p>

 * NOTE:  The specification <A HREF="http://www.opengis.org/docs/02-087r3.pdf">Catalog Services 1.1.1</A>
 * does not specify the methods of the Catalog interface.  The methods in this interface
