MODULE MAIN
===========
Welcome to the "main" module, this module started out built around core. For GeoTools 2.0 (and
the move to subversion), default implementations from several existing modules were merged in
order to limit developer confusion.  These origional modules are still tracked (and where named
obvious things like feature, filter, style,....).

Much of the origional code comes from the dawn of time - say 1996 but was only punted together
under a GeoTools PMC (C) in 2002 as part of a merge of the existing GeoTools project with the
work of Martin.

This module is the "white whale" bottleneck with the most contributions and problems, currently
it lists James as the module maintainer, but in practice it is a burden and thus falls on the
PMC for maintence.

Module Maintainer:
- feature
- filter & expression - Corey
- styling - Corey

- LICENSE.txt updated

org.geotools.catalog
--------------------
Ported from uDig project (LGPL) w/ permission for (C) to PMC as part of GeoTools 2.2 (thanks Justin).
IP:
- updated header to (C) 2005 Refractions Research
- updated header to (C) 2005-2006 PMC

org.geotools.catalog.adaptable
------------------------------
Seems to be mostly new created by Justin in order to allow for the "extensible interface pattern"
tipified by the Eclipse IAdaptable interace. Since he is following the uDig example the method names
do not conflict with those of IResource and there should be no problem again eclipse.org codebase.

IP:
- Updated to (C) 2006 PMC w/ (C) 2005 Refractions
- TODO Confirm with Justin what is going on
- ResolveFactoryFinder obviously justin so only (C) 2006 PMC

org.geotools.catalog.defauls
----------------------------
Seems to be mostly ports of the default implementation from uDig.
IP:
- Updated to (C) 2006 PMC w/ (C) 2005 Refractions
- TODO Confirm with Justin what is going on

org.geotools.data
-----------------
The contents of the data package were overhalled for the GeoTools 2.0 release, this package
contains the default implementations, and a bit more utility classes then can be sensibly
figured out.
IP:
- Updated to (C) 2003-2006 PMC
- Diff had no header, assume (C) 2006 TODO wait for email list to report back
- FileDataStore & Finder (C) 2004-2005

org.geotools.data.collection
----------------------------
Included to clean up code as part of GeoTools 2.2, common utility classes.
IP:
- updated to (C) 2005-2006 PMC

org.geotools.data.coverage.grid
org.geotools.data.coverage.grid.file
org.geotools.data.coverage.grid.stream
--------------------------------------
Part of initial grid coverage work for uDig project, at least one file contained an incorrect header
with (C) Refractions Reserach. Since this code was never released as part of uDig, this was
simply a developer mistake.
IP:
- updated to (C) 2004-2006
- removed (C) 2004 Refraction Research (see above note)

org.geotools.data.crs
---------------------
Initially created for GeoTools 2.0 to provide reader implementations for reprojection / forceprojection, initial
AuthorityFactory interface provided for GeoTools 2.1 since deprecated and moved to referencing.
IP:
- CRSAuthorityFactory (C) 2004-2006 PMC
- others (C) 2003-2006 PMC

org.geotools.data.jdbc
----------------------
Created to "save" previous data source implementations, and provide an abstract class for JDBC DataStore
implementations. Warning scariest series of hacks we got ... code added for GeoTools 2.0, 2.1 and 2.2.
IP:
- feature source code (C) 2002-2006 as it preserves pre geotools 2.0 code
- datastore code (C) 2003-2006
- hacks mostly (C) 2004-2006

org.geotools.data.jdbc.attributeio
----------------------------------
Part of origional attribute reader based design for datastore.
IP:
- updated headers to (C) 2003-2006 PMC

org.geotools.data.jdbc.fidmapper
--------------------------------
Merged from an experimental branch in 2004, thanks andrea.
IP:
- updated headers to (C)2004-2006 PMC
- some funny todo notes from david adler in headers

org.geotools.data.jdbc.referencing
----------------------------------
Seems to be added by jesse, probably a port of early access based EPSG authority?
IP:
- headers to (C) 2004-2006
- ask Jesse for confirmation, confirmed as 2004

org.geotools.data.memory
------------------------
Created as the API proof of concept for GeoTools 2.0 DataStore API. MemoryDataStore added
for GeoTools 2.0 (although really a port of DefaulFeatureCollection).
IP:
- memorydatastore header to (C) 2003-2006 PMC
- memoryfeaturecollection header to (C) 2002-2006 PMC

org.geotools.data.ows
---------------------
Added to support OGC Open Web Services constructs, for WMS client code and WFS datastore code.
Implemened for GeoTools 2.1 as part of the uDig project.
IP:
- headers updated to (C) 2004-2006 PMC

org.geotools.data.store
-----------------------
Remaining code from first cut at supporting metadata, code retained as the start of a replacement
for AbstractDataStore based on what we have learned. Code origionally based on GeoServer internals,
for end product see the catalog package.

IP:
- headers (C)2004-2006 PMC
- removed (C) 2004 Refraction Research / uDig headers (since they are a mistake)

org.geotools.data.view
----------------------
Support read only view on feature source information, port of internal GPL GeoServer code
donated to PMC.
IP:
- updated to (C) 2004-2006 PMC

org.geotools.event
------------------
Added for GeoTools 2.2 as part of adding events to the SLD documents. Origionally based
on uDig catalog event system - compare and contrast (or bloody well merge) with the
current catalog package.
IP:
- updated headers to (C) 2005-2006 PMC

org.geotools.factory
--------------------
Implementation to help find GeoAPI factories on the classpath.
- header to (C) 2006 PMC, changed to LGPL license w/out address

org.geotools.feature
--------------------
Feature model used since before GeoTools 2.0. Changed to use of FeatureCollection for
data results for GeoTools 2.1, and added FeatureVisitor for GeoTools 2.2. 
There seems to be lots of dead code in here - the FM branch cannot merge soon enough.

IP:
- header to (C) 2002-2006 PMC in most cases
- AbstractFeatureCollectoin to (C) 2004
- removed a uDig header (mistake no doubt)

org.geotools.feature.collection
-------------------------------
Helper classes for feature collections added in GeoTools 2.2.
IP:
- headers to (C) 2005-2006 PMC

org.geotools.feature.type
-------------------------
Congruent with the feature package, this tracts the feature model, this code
predates GeoTools 2.0.

Added for GeoTools2.2 as the brains behind aggregate functions.
IP:
- headers to (C) 2005-2006 PMC
- two files missing headers

org.geotools.filter
-------------------
Origional pre GeoTools 2.0 code, revised to agree with Filter 1.1 specification for GeoTools 2.2, and
then subclassed from GeoAPI for GeoTools 2.3.
IP:
- some files from justin were missing all headers/comments updated to (C) 2006 PMC
- headers updated to (C) 200x-2006 PMC as required
- a few early files contain an addition (C) 2002, Centre for Computational Geography

org.geotools.filter.expression
------------------------------
All files added by justin as part GeoTools 2.3 move to GeoAPI interfaces.
IP:

org.geotools.filter.function
----------------------------
Contains a mix of interesting functions, some of which are auto generated. Most date from GeoTools 2.1
timeframe as they are used to provided a better SLD experience for GeoServer. GeoTools 2.2 has
introduced some aggregation functions wrapped over the visitor framework.
IP:
- headers updated to (C) 2005-2006 PMC
- ExplicitClassificationFunction missing headers
