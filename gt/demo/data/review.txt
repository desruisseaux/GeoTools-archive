DEMO DATA
=========
This module is used to capture working examples of using the geotools data system. It was
added for GeoTools 2.3 as the start of a user guide documentation project.

Some of the example code come from either the wiki, or previous attempts at demo code.
I was not paying attention during its creation so am not sure of the details.
