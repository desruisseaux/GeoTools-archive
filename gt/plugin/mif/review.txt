MapInfo MIF DataStore access.

org.geotools.data.mif
---------------------
Cannot determine date offline :-( Seem to think this may be a port of an old GeoTools Data Source
from before the 2.0 release. Could guess it is after 2003 due to header aggreement with the
developers guide, but will need to check svn:

IP:
- updated headers to (C) 2002-2006 PMC
- TODO: check against svn dates


org.geotools.data.mif (test)
---------------------
IP:
- updated headers to (C) 2002-2006 PMC
- unable to determine IP of test data
