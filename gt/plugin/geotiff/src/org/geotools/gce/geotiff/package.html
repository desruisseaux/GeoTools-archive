  <BODY>
    A grid coverage exchange to manage the GeoTIFF Revision 1.0 format. 

    <p>
    This package is going to be &quot;evolutionary&quot;, rather than 
    &quot;revolutionary&quot;.   As functionality is added to the package, 
    this page will be updated.  This page should be considered a current 
    synopsis of the capabilities of the module.  

    <p>
    <h1>Requirements</h1>
    This package requires that the runtime environment have access to 
    Java Advanced Imaging (JAI) and the JAI Image I/O extensions available
    from <A HREF="http://java.sun.com">Sun</A>.  Specifically, the 
    <code>GeoTiffFormatFactorySpi</code>
    will report itself unavailable if any of the following are unavailable:
    <ul>
    <li> <code>javax.media.jai.JAI</code>
    <li> <code>com.sun.media.jai.operator.ImageReadDescriptor</code>
    <li> <code>com.sun.media.imageio.plugins.tiff.GeoTIFFTagSet</code>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
    Other classes are of course necessary to successfully read in the GeoTIFF 
    image.  As they typically come bundled with one or more of the above, 
    they are assumed to be present if all of the above are present.
    
    <p>
    <h1>Current Functionality</h1>
    <p>
    The current iteration of the GeoTIFF plugin will read GeoTIFF files with the 
    following restrictions:
    <ul>
    <li> The coordinate system must be either projected or geographic 
        (geodetic coordinate systems not supported.)
    <li> The <code>CoordinateSystemAuthorityFactory</code> must successfully 
      construct the Coordinate System object.
    <li> The Raster to Model transformation must be a simple translation.
    </ul>

    <p>
    The GeoTIFF plugin currently does not write GeoTIFF files.  The 
    current obstacles to writing a GeoTIFF file are:
    <ol>
    <li> The <CODE>GeoTiffIIOMetadataAdapter</CODE> cannot modify the 
      IIOMetadata object.
    <li> No mechanism exists to examine the parameters of a coordinate
      system and produce an EPSG code.
    </ol>

    <p>Key features of the package: 
    <ol>
    <li>The user may specify the <code>CoordinateSystemAuthorityFactory</code>
      used to generate coordinate systems from codes found in the metadata.
    <li>Utilizes the JAI ImageI/O tools to perform the actual file I/O.
    <li>Interprets metadata retrieved as <code>IIOMetadata</code>.
    <li>Functionality is logically subdivided:
      <ul> 
      <li> Classes required to interface to Geotools.
      <li> An adapter class to retrieve GeoKeys from the IIOMetadata by
        symbolic name (<CODE>GeoTiffIIOMetadataAdapter</CODE>).
      <li> An adapter class to interpret the values in the GeoKeys
        and create a corresponding coordinate system with a factory
        (<CODE>GeoTiffCoordinateSystemAdapter</CODE>).
      </ul>
    </ol>
