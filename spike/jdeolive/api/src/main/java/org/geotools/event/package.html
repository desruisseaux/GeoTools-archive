  Allows for events on GeoTools nested data structures.
  <p>
  Several of the GeoTools objects are produced in reference to
  specifications, in particular XML based specifications. Often
  we try and match the same abstractions present in a specification
  like SLD or Filter. But rather then make use of pure Java Beans, and
  make user interface code responsible for managing a host of listeners
  we are providing a single set of listeners located at the object
  matching the document base.
  <p>
  For more Details:
  <ul>
  <li>This design is similar to EMF, or JFace use (aka borrow code examples)
  <li>Not specific to Documents (just nesting),
      the Catalog api will use these events
  <li>We do try and match the document structure perfectly for Feature/FeatureCollection/GML
  (so that the same XPath expressions can be respected). FeatureCollection and
  Feature have their own well explored structure and issues and will not be using
  this event system. Given the size of FeatureCollections it is not practicle for each
  child to "know" its parent.
  </ul>
