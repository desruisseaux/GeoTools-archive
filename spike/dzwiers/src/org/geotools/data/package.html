This package, and the four sub packages reley heavily on the Catalog 
implementation. In many cases it is posible to represent the information 
and modification requests in terms of CatalogEntrys. Please pay particular 
attention to the super interface, in many cases what you are looking for 
will be hidden there.

This pacakge contains common data access definitions. the feature subclass 
is particular to feature sources, and .grid for grid sources. Both these 
packages have a min package ... representing the minimum a developer 
would have to write to get this going.

Catalog -- We used this as a base to allow for easy abstraction between 
multiple data types and sources from a user's point of view. Much of the 
Catalog API can be used directly by client UIs.

We should also note that ALL factories are responsible for caching! This is
vital, as this allows the seemless modification and re-parameterization 
between data sources.
